# ⚔️ Neopets Battledome Overlay

## 📚 Description

This project adds a series of quality of life improvements to the user experience in the Neopets Battledome!

These will mostly be focused on 2-player battling, but any suggestions or ideas for 1P may also be explored.

## 🧭 Roadmap

### [Currently WIP] v1.0.0 | Battle Log Improvements

 This feature will allow users to preserve their battle logs throughout the battle and scroll through any previous rounds, even if they close the browser and reopen the battle! 

A stretch goal for this feature will be to allow users to save their logs so that they can review them offline without having to copy and paste every round manually.

### v2.0.0 | TBA!
